# Tabcrush

This was to be an [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) package
for efficient large-scale tabular data editing, to be used as a
dependency for [µTunes](https://github.com/radian-software/utunes).
However, I abandoned development on the features of µTunes that were
to require Tabcrush.
